# Deep Learning

It sub set of ML which is uses Ariticial neural network to process data and make decisions. It handles masive unstructure data. 

## Types of Deep Learning:
- supervised
- unsupervised
- semi- supervised
- reinforcement

## Deep learning in Practical use:
- Autonomous Vechile 
- Speach Recognition
- Finance
- Image Recognition

## Why we are using deeplearning if we already have machine learning?

M.L is strugle of handling large dataset and unstructure data while D.L can effectively handle large and unstructure data. Feature extracting can be done automaticly in D.L while we have to do manually in ML

## How DeepLearning 
1) Data Processing: D.L works on masive dataset so its need process the data first it remove noise from the data in this process. Like if there are image in dataset it will re-size it. If there is any image it done tokennization, or word embedding

2) Select Neural Network Architecture: Select suitable neural network architure which suits your goals if your goal is to make to image genration and you selecting CNN architecture which is good for image recognization then it is not good approch 

## Types of Neural Network Architure

- RNN: (Recurrent Neural network)  Used for NLP, speech recognition, and text generation
- CNN: (Convolutional Neural network) Used Image recognition, Object detection, Computer Vision, Face recognization
- GAN: (Genrative Adversial Network) Used for deepfake genrative, Genrate image from text, Syntatic image, Voice cloning, deekfake videos

3) Forward Propagation: When a input passed thought Deep Learning model it travel from no of neuron which apply mathmatical trasformation to generate meaningful feature this process is called Forward Propagation.
Like if I give text as a input it will process from no of neuron then will generate output.

4) Loss function: It refer to that how good and how poorly model predict atacual value. It is diffrence between predicted and actual values
- Mean square error for Regration
- Cross-Entropy for Classifiacation 

5) Backpropagation: it is a method used to train neural network. Its goal is to reduce the difference between the modelâ€™s predicted output and the actual output by adjusting the weights and biases in the network.

## Gradient Descent: 

It adjust weight used to minimize the loss function in machine learning 

## Chalanges of Deep Learning? 
- Computational challenges: Required high power GPU
- Biasness in data: Biasness in data give improper result
- Privacy and ethical chalangess
- Memory Limitation: Need lot to memory while running on devices   

## What is ANN?

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of computer program inspired by how the human brain works. It is used to recognize patterns, make predictions, and solve complex problems like identifying images, understanding speech and many more.

## Architure of ANN Consists of:
- Input Layer : Take data
- Hidden Layer: Process the data using mathametical method
- output Layer: Produce output or generate result
