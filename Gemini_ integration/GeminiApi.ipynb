      "Human walking, while seemingly effortless, is a complex interplay of biomechanics, neurology, and muscle activity. Here's a breakdown of the process:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The Gait Cycle:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Walking is characterized by a cyclical pattern called the **gait cycle**. This cycle has two main phases:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Stance Phase (approx. 60% of the cycle):** When the foot is in contact with the ground. This phase provides support and propels the body forward. It's further divided into several sub-phases:\n",
      "    *   **Heel Strike/Initial Contact:** The heel of one foot contacts the ground.\n",
      "    *   **Foot Flat/Loading Response:** The foot rolls from heel to toes, accepting the body's weight.\n",
      "    *   **Midstance:** The body weight is directly over the supporting leg.  This is a period of single-leg balance.\n",
      "    *   **Heel Off/Terminal Stance:** The heel lifts off the ground as weight shifts towards the forefoot.\n",
      "    *   **Toe Off/Preswing:** The toes push off the ground, initiating the swing phase.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Swing Phase (approx. 40% of the cycle):** When the foot is off the ground and moving forward. This phase positions the leg for the next stance phase. It's divided into:\n",
      "    *   **Initial Swing:** The foot lifts off the ground, and the knee begins to flex.\n",
      "    *   **Midswing:** The leg continues to move forward, passing beneath the body.\n",
      "    *   **Terminal Swing:** The leg extends in preparation for heel strike.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Key Movements and Muscle Actions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ankle:**  At heel strike, the ankle is slightly dorsiflexed (toes pointed up). It plantarflexes (toes pointed down) during foot flat to absorb impact and plantarflexes powerfully during toe-off to propel the body. Muscles involved include the tibialis anterior (dorsiflexion), gastrocnemius and soleus (plantarflexion).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Knee:** The knee is slightly flexed at heel strike to cushion the impact. It extends during midstance for stability and flexes again during swing phase to clear the foot from the ground. Muscles involved include the quadriceps (extension) and hamstrings (flexion).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hip:** The hip extends during stance phase to propel the body forward and flexes during swing phase to bring the leg forward. Muscles involved include the gluteus maximus (extension), iliopsoas (flexion), and hamstrings (extension and rotation).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Pelvis:** The pelvis rotates slightly in the horizontal plane to increase stride length and reduce energy expenditure.  It also tilts forward and backward to help with balance and smooth movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Trunk and Arms:** The trunk rotates in opposition to the pelvis to maintain balance. The arms swing in coordination with the legs, contributing to balance and momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Neurological Control:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Walking is primarily controlled by the central nervous system (CNS), specifically:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Brain:** The motor cortex initiates and controls voluntary movements like starting, stopping, and changing direction. The cerebellum coordinates movements and maintains balance.\n",
      "*   **Spinal Cord:** The spinal cord contains central pattern generators (CPGs), which are neural circuits that produce rhythmic, repetitive movements like walking. These CPGs are responsible for coordinating the alternating muscle contractions in the legs.\n",
      "*   **Peripheral Nerves:** These nerves transmit signals from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles, and relay sensory information from the muscles and joints back to the CNS.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Biomechanics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Balance and Stability:**  Walking requires constant adjustments to maintain balance. Sensory input from the eyes, inner ear (vestibular system), and proprioceptors (sensors in muscles and joints) provides information about body position and movement.\n",
      "*   **Energy Efficiency:**  The body uses various mechanisms to minimize energy expenditure during walking, such as utilizing pendulum-like motion of the legs, storing and releasing elastic energy in tendons, and optimizing muscle activation patterns.\n",
      "*   **Ground Reaction Force:**  The ground exerts a force back on the foot with each step. The magnitude and direction of this force influence the stress on joints and muscles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, walking is a complex and coordinated process involving:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cyclical Gait Pattern:**  Stance and Swing phases.\n",
      "*   **Muscle Actions:** Precise contractions of various muscle groups to control joint movements.\n",
      "*   **Neurological Control:**  Coordination by the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.\n",
      "*   **Biomechanics:**  Maintaining balance, optimizing energy efficiency, and managing forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any disruption in this complex system (e.g., muscle weakness, neurological damage, joint pain) can significantly impact walking ability.\n",

      "But\n",

In this case, the response object is not a single answer but a stream of chunks (pieces of the full answer). The for chunk in response: will go through each chunk of the response one by one.\n",
