# Reinforcement Learning

It is technique which uses Trial and error method by which AI is learn by trailing and error unlike superviced learning in which we have to give large no label data and from that AI will learn or recognize. In Reinformcement learning AI will not only memorised the rule but also discover them. 

## Why Reinforcement Learning is diffrent from others?

Most AI models train on large supervised dataset in which human need interaction in supervised learning it consists of input and output pairs in which input have attached with correct output. But in reinforcement learning agent reach with environment (Agent) The entity that make decision (Environment) The system agent interect with. It learn based on reward sytem. 

- Agent and Environment
- Reward System
- Trial and Errors

## Agent and Evironment : 
Agent is an AI which is learning and Environment is the system agent is interacting.

For Example: Chitti from Robot movie "Chitti is an Agent which is learning" and Prof Vasikaran is Envirnoment from which is interacting.

## Action Reward System :
It AI will doing something benificial action the envirnoment will give reward and if the action is not good envirnment will give penalty.

Example: Like if Chitti is taking positive or good action the Vasikaran will take Chitti into Sana Party. And When Chitti is taking bad actions Vasikaran dismental Chitti

## Trial and Error : 
It means means AI will learn by try diffrent thing and doing errors learn from their experience.

Example: Chitti try diffrent hairstyle when he is going Sana Party
